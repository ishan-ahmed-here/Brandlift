SEMrush collects data through a multi-pronged approach that combines proprietary technology, partnerships, and user-generated inputs to deliver comprehensive digital marketing insights. The platform gathers live and historical data from search engines, primarily Google, by analyzing search engine results pages (SERPs) for millions of keywords and tracking rankings across different geographies and devices. This data is refreshed regularly to ensure accuracy, with keyword rankings updated monthly and live data reflecting recent trends. For traffic estimation, Semrush relies on a panel of over 200 million anonymized internet users across 190 countries, sourced from hundreds of clickstream data providers, which generates nearly 2 billion events daily. This clickstream data is processed using a proprietary Neural Network algorithm that applies statistical sampling and error testing to generate realistic traffic estimates. Additionally, Semrush collects data on backlinks through its own crawler, gathers paid search data from Google Ads and Shopping ads, and integrates information from public APIs of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The platform also uses user input, such as keyword and domain searches, to build and refine its databases, and incorporates data from third-party sources like Google Analytics and Google Search Console to enhance its reporting capabilities. All collected data is processed by sophisticated machine learning algorithms to calculate metrics like keyword difficulty, search volume, and domain authority, which are used to provide actionable insights for SEO and digital marketing strategies Ubersuggest collects data through a combination of Google's API and third-party sources to provide comprehensive SEO and keyword research insights. The tool updates its data monthly, processing a vast amount of information—equivalent to nearly 75.2 billion Google searches per month—requiring up to six days for processing, which can result in no data being visible during the first few days of the month. This data includes search volume, cost-per-click (CPC), competition metrics, and seasonal trends for keywords across Google, YouTube, and Amazon. Ubersuggest also leverages the MOZ API to gather backlink data, which is used to assess domain authority and referring domains. Users can enhance the accuracy of their reports by connecting their Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts, which allows Ubersuggest to pull in personalized data on organic traffic and keyword performance.
